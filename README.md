## Reflection
This is my first serious project where I dedicated a large amount of time to. Was my first time using sass and react-router and I was able to create a functioning website. I feel as if I didn't use all what sass has to offer but I feel comfortable using it in future projects. Inspiration for the website design was a mix of many e-commerce websites; any functionality I liked from a website I would try to mimic and implement it on my own. Easiest part was the functionality but the hardest was styling the website. Some problems I encoutered was overflowing and creating the scroll component for the landing page. Trying to figure out when the end of the scroll bar was reached took the longest. This was also the first time using useRef and now I feel like I have a very good understandng. Lastly, I would like to convert this into a full stack application which I will implement once I have learned about back end.
