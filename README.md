## Reflection
This is my first serious project where I dedicated a large amount of time to. Was my first time using sass and react-router and I was able to create a functioning website. I feel as if I didn't use all what sass has to offer but I feel comfortable using it in future projects. Inspiration for the website design was a mix of many e-commerce websites; any functionality I liked from a website I would try to mimic and implement it on my own. Easiest part was the functionality but the hardest was styling the website. Some problems I encoutered was overflowing and creating the scroll component for the landing page. Trying to figure out when the end of the scroll bar was reached took the longest. This was also the first time using useRef and now I feel like I have a very good understandng. Lastly, I would like to convert this into a full stack application which I will implement once I have learned about back end.

### Update (Backend Integration)
Finishing this project up was very daunting especially because many of the features I implemented in the backend were not fully implemented into the frontend due to time constraints. Even though this was disappointing I still can implement them in the future! Some key things I noticed when learning the backend was I should have just use PostgreSQL instead of Mongodb. I learned how to use a database but for what I was creating a relational database would have been easier to work with and I understand the pitfalls of Mongodb. Regardless I learned a lot about database design especially due to a lot of trial and error. One thing I should have done was plan everything out instead of diving nose in first which led to to the integration to the frontend way longer than it should have been. Nevertheless this project was a stepping stone to learn more about computers on a deeper level and honestly allow me to be comfortable with code I might not understand at first. Lastly my design skills feel like they have gotten much better. I took a lot of inspiration from other big e-commerce website such as the review section of Hot Topic and the filtering system from H&M which gave me a better vision of what I wanted my website to be. This was a double edged sword because many times I wanted to implelement certain functions into my website which would cause me to change the structure of my database or even my entire backend, but in the end I was very satisfied with how my website looked and how it functioned. Even though I enjoyed this project a lot I'm glad it's over and I can start my next venture!
